# Read-my-insane-confessions-here.
Because I deserved to have my deepest and darkest secrets revealed. (They're in the README file)

* When I was 11, I had an obsession with JFK and yumeshipped myself with him and drew some very suggestive art. (I had uploaded a speedpaint of one to yt but it's currently unlisted)
* I harbored animosity towards the artists in the lostwave community because art isn't really a majority there since it's mostly searching and sourcing music. I thought of myself as superior to other artists and called myself the best at drawing in the lostwave community.

more coming soon btw
